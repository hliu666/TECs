SNF Leaf Optical Properties: Cary-14: Data Set Guide Document

Summary:

Leaf Optical PropertiesIntroduction

Knowledge of the optical properties of the components of the 
forest canopy is important to the understanding of how plants 
interact with their environment and how this information may be 
used to determine vegetation characteristics using remote 
sensing.

During the summers of 1983 and 1984, samples of the major 
components of the boreal forest canopy (needles, leaves, 
branches, moss, litter) were collected in the Superior National 
Forest (SNF) of Minnesota and sent to the Johnson Space Center 
(JSC).  At JSC, the spectral reflectance and transmittance 
characteristics of the samples were determined for wavelengths 
between .35 and 2.1 micrometers using the Cary-14 radiometer.  
This report presents plots of these data as well as averages to 
the Thematic Mapper  Simulator (TMS) bands.

There were two main thrusts to the SNF optical properties study.  
The first was to collect the optical properties of many of the 
components of the boreal forest canopy.  The reflectance and 
transmittance properties of the leaves and needles of eight major 
overstory tree species and three understory shrubs were measured.  
Also, reflectance measurements were made for the bark of several 
tree species, sphagnum moss and leaf litter.  The second goal of 
the study was to investigate the variability of optical 
properties within a species.  Measurements of reflectance and 
transmittance of quaking aspen leaves and black spruce needles 
were made at three levels in the canopy and for three stand 
densities.  The results of these studies allow a comparison of 
the optical properties of a variety of different species and a 
measure of the variability within species.  These data provide 
basic information necessary to model canopy reflectance patterns.

Methodology

The vegetation samples were collected in the SNF and placed in 
zip-lock plastic bags.  These bags were packed in cardboard boxes 
and sent to JSC by priority mail.  Samples were collected from 
late August through September in 1983.  In 1984 samples were 
collected May 23, June 25 and August 14 and mailed the same day.  
It took between three and six days for the samples to reach JSC.  

The handling of the samples at JSC evolved over time.  In 1983 
and early 1984, the samples were stored in plastic bags and 
refrigerated at JSC.  Later, due to problems with too much 
wetness on the leaves, the branches were not refrigerated and 
their ends were put in water to keep the leaves alive.

The optical properties were measured using the Cary-14 system at 
JSC. The Cary-14 has a wavelength range between 0.35 and 2.1 
micrometers.  The sampling interval varies between 0.002 and 0.01 
micrometers, depending on the rate of change between the values 
in each sample interval.  Each measurement samples at 
approximately 250 different wavelengths.

Optical property measurements were made for both the tops and 
bottoms of leaves.  When leaf top or bottom is refered to in 
these observations it indicates the side of the leaf which is 
illuminated by the Cary-14.  For observing broad leaves, a sample 
of the leaf without holes or visible defects was used, however, 
for needle leaves either a collection of individual needles were 
alined in the instrument holder or a section of twig with needles 
attached was used.  

The optical properties measured by the Cary-14 are provided in the
data set "SNF Leaf Optical Properties: Cary-14". Since the Cary-14
does not sample in exactly the same wavelengths in each measurement,
the data were resampled using a one-dimensional quasi-cubic hermite
interpolation before averaging.  These Cary-14 reflectance and 
transmittance values were then averaged to Thematic Mapper Simulator 
wavelength bands and are provided in the data set "SNF Leaf Optical
Properties: TMS".  

Results

Three species of broad leafed deciduous trees were sampled: paper 
birch (Betula papyrifera), red maple (Acer rubum) and quaking 
aspen (Populus tremuloides).  In the visible spectral region
(0.4 to 0.7 µm), most of the radiation is absorbed by the leaf and
little is reflected or transmitted.  Reflectance 
and transmittance minima occur at approximately 0.45 and 0.65 µm 
due to chlorophyll absorption.  The near infrared region (0.7 to 
1.3 µm) is characterized by very high reflectance and 
transmittance and low absorptance. The internal structure of the 
leaf determines the optical properties in this region.  The 
middle infrared (1.3 to 3.0 µm) is dominated by strong water 
absorption bands at approximately 1.4 and 1.9 µm.  Reflectance 
and transmittance in the mid infrared is related to the amount of 
water in the leaf.

The birch and maple leaves were all collected on the same day and 
received the same treatment.  The leaf top reflectance and 
transmittance are very close for all four samples in all 
wavelengths measured.  However, there is a great deal of 
variation in the leaf bottom transmittance.  The differences in 
leaf optical properties for these four samples do not seem to be 
related to the differences in species or canopy height.

Quaking aspen leaves were sampled for three canopy heights and 
three stand densities. When the aspen optical properties were   
plotted, a striking differences between the optical properties
of healthy and diseased leaves was noted.  The diseased leaves 
had a much lower reflectance in both the near and mid infrared regions.
This effect occured even when the leaf appeared green.  In one example,
the leaf sample was described as being "most uniform in color and clean",
but, once more, in the near and mid infrared the reflectance was much lower 
than the healthy leaves.  The diseased leaves also had a much 
higher transmittance in all wavelength bands.

The leaf top reflectance for aspen show that in the visible region
the high density stand has a lower reflectance.  In the infrared regions
the reflectances do not distinguish between stand density or crown height.
The mid infrared wavelengths show the most separability between the 
different samples.  The variability between different aspen 
leaves is greater than the variability between the birch and 
maple samples.  The leaf top reflectances of the birch and maple 
match up well with aspen from the high density stand in the 
visible.  However, aspen has a much higher reflectance in the 
near infrared.  In the mid infrared the birch and maple 
reflectances fall within the range of the aspen, but the aspen 
tends to have a slightly higher reflectance.

The aspen leaf bottom reflectances tend to be higher than the leaf
top reflectances in all wavelengths.  In the visible, this is readily
seen in the light color of the aspen leaf bottoms.  The aspen leaf
bottom reflectances do not show any pattern due to canopy height or 
stand density.  The leaf bottom reflectance is similar between 
aspen, birch and maple in the visible but in the infrared the 
aspen has the higher leaf bottom reflectance.

Aspen leaf transmittance is slightly greater in the infrared for
high density stands versus low density stands.  The maple and birch 
leaf transmittances tend to be greater in all wavelengths than 
the aspen.

Bark reflectance for aspen varies greatly in all wavelengths.
There are two spectral reflectance patterns for the bark. The first
pattern has a steep jump in reflectance at 0.7 µm and high near
infrared reflectance values.  The second bark reflectance pattern does
not have the jump at 0.7 µm and increases monotonically through the
visible and near infrared.  Both bark types have similar patterns in
the mid infrared. The first type of bark tends to be found in the upper 
crown of the aspen.  The second type of bark is found low in the 
aspen canopy suggesting that it is older bark.

Five species of needle leafed trees were sampled in this study: 
jack pine (Pinus banksiana), red pine (Pinus resinosa), larch 
(Larix laricina), balsam fir (Abies balsamea) and black spruce 
(Picea glauca).  While the reflectance pattern of the needle leafed
trees is similar to broad leaves, the reflectance of the 
needles is much more variable in all wavelengths. The variability 
in needle reflectance is not just a function of species since 
jack pine has both high and low reflectance values.  In the 
visible region, the red pine and larch reflectances are similar 
to broad leaf reflectance, but fir and the low value for jack 
pine are much less.  In the near infrared plateau, there are two 
depressions occuring around 1.0 and 1.2 µm.  These depressions 
are also present in broad leaves but are less pronounced.  Broad 
leaf reflectance in the near infrared falls in the middle of the 
range of needle near infrared reflectances.  In the mid infrared 
region, broad leaf reflectance is much higher than that of needles.
The needle bottom reflectance has similar characteristics as the
needle top reflectance.  In the visible region, fir has a greater
bottom reflectance than top reflectance.

Needle transmittance is much lower in all wavelengths than that of
broad leaves.

While the reflectance of the bark of needle leafed treesshows a
great deal of variability, the pattern of the reflectance is the
same as that of aspen bark from the lower canopy.  The needle
leaved tree bark does not show a jump at the visible-near infrared
boundary as does some of the aspen bark.

Several samples of black spruce needles were measured to look at 
the variability of optical properties within a conifer species.  
Spruce needle top reflectance falls mid range with other needle 
reflectances.  Within spruce, needles from high density stands 
have highest reflectance in near and mid infrared.  Needles from 
a middle density stand have lower reflectance in the near and mid 
infrared, with reflectances of needles from a low density stand 
being lowest in the near infrared and about the same as the mid 
density needles in the mid infrared.  Spruce needle reflectance 
data taken in 1983 were of a combination of both the tops and 
bottoms of the needles.  The results are comparable with the 1984
data in the near and mid infrared, however the 1983 visible
reflectances are much higher than the 1984 data.  This is not due
to the effects of needle bottom reflectance in 1983 samples since
the 1984 needle bottom reflectances in the visible are not much 
different than that of the needle tops and much lower than the 
1983 visible reflectances.  Spruce needle reflectance in comparison
with aspen leaf reflectance is a little lower in the visible, much
lower in the near infrared, and greatly lower in the mid infrared.

Spruce needle transmittance is slightly higher than other needle
transmittance in the visible and near infrared regions.  In
comparison with aspen leaf transmittance, they are nearly equal
in the visible, spruce is slightly lower in the near infrared,
and much lower in the mid infrared.

Three species of understory shrubs were sampled: beaked hazel 
(Corylus cornuta), labrador tea (Ledum groenlandicum) and 
leatherleaf (Chamaedaphne calyculata).  Only leaf top reflectance
was determined for labrador tea and leatherleaf.  The labrador tea
and leatherleaf have very high reflectances in the near infrared
compared to other leaves or needles sampled.  The hazel has much
lower reflectance in the near infrared.  The water absorption bands
at 1.4 and 1.9 µm are not very deep for the hazel.

Sphagnum moss (Sphagnum spp.) reflectance is extremely variable
in all bands.  The difference between samples may be caused by
differences in location, moisture or type of sphagnum.  Background
reflectance can have a significant effect on the total canopy reflectance.
If sphagnum is the background, the reflectance may vary with place and time.
This variable background can be an important complication in the understanding 
of reflectance images of the boreal forest regions.

In contrast to the sphagnum reflectance is the reflectance of 
aspen leaf litter.  The leaf litter reflectance is much different than
that of the sphagnum and appears to be more like the needle leafed
tree bark.

Leaf Optical PropertiesIntroduction

Knowledge of the optical properties of the components of the 
forest canopy is important to the understanding of how plants 
interact with their environment and how this information may be 
used to determine vegetation characteristics using remote 
sensing.

During the summers of 1983 and 1984, samples of the major 
components of the boreal forest canopy (needles, leaves, 
branches, moss, litter) were collected in the Superior National

characteristics of the samples were determined for wavelengths 
between .35 and 2.1 micrometers using the Cary-14 radiometer.

Also, reflectance measurements were made for the bark of several

Results

Three species of broad leafed deciduous trees were sampled: paper 
birch (Betula papyrifera), red maple (Acer rubum) and quaking 
aspen (Populus tremuloides).  In the visible spectral region
(0.4 to 0.7 µm), most of the radiation is absorbed by the leaf and
little is reflected or transmitted.  Reflectance 
and transmittance minima occur at approximately 0.45 and 0.65 µm 
due to chlorophyll absorption.  The near infrared region (0.7 to 
1.3 µm) is characterized by very high reflectance and 
transmittance and low absorptance. The internal structure of the 
leaf determines the optical properties in this region.  The 
middle infrared (1.3 to 3.0 µm) is dominated by strong water 
absorption bands at approximately 1.4 and 1.9 µm.  Reflectance 
and transmittance in the mid infrared is related to the amount of 
water in the leaf.

The birch and maple leaves were all collected on the same day and 
received the same treatment.  The leaf top reflectance and 
transmittance are very close for all four samples in all 
wavelengths measured.  However, there is a great deal of 
variation in the leaf bottom transmittance.  The differences in 
leaf optical properties for these four samples do not seem to be 
related to the differences in species or canopy height.

Quaking aspen leaves were sampled for three canopy heights and 
three stand densities. When the aspen optical properties were   
plotted, a striking differences between the optical properties
of healthy and diseased leaves was noted.  The diseased leaves 
had a much lower reflectance in both the near and mid infrared regions.
This effect occured even when the leaf appeared green.  In one example,
the leaf sample was described as being "most uniform in color and clean",
but, once more, in the near and mid infrared the reflectance was much lower 
than the healthy leaves.  The diseased leaves also had a much 
higher transmittance in all wavelength bands.

The leaf top reflectance for aspen show that in the visible region
the high density stand has a lower reflectance.  In the infrared regions
the reflectances do not distinguish between stand density or crown height.
The mid infrared wavelengths show the most separability between the 
different samples.  The variability between different aspen 
leaves is greater than the variability between the birch and 
maple samples.  The leaf top reflectances of the birch and maple 
match up well with aspen from the high density stand in the 
visible.  However, aspen has a much higher reflectance in the 
near infrared.  In the mid infrared the birch and maple 
reflectances fall within the range of the aspen, but the aspen 
tends to have a slightly higher reflectance.

The aspen leaf bottom reflectances tend to be higher than the leaf
top reflectances in all wavelengths.  In the visible, this is readily
seen in the light color of the aspen leaf bottoms.  The aspen leaf
bottom reflectances do not show any pattern due to canopy height or 
stand density.  The leaf bottom reflectance is similar between 
aspen, birch and maple in the visible but in the infrared the 
aspen has the higher leaf bottom reflectance.

Aspen leaf transmittance is slightly greater in the infrared for
high density stands versus low density stands.  The maple and birch 
leaf transmittances tend to be greater in all wavelengths than 
the aspen.

Bark reflectance for aspen varies greatly in all wavelengths.
There are two spectral reflectance patterns for the bark. The first
pattern has a steep jump in reflectance at 0.7 µm and high near
infrared reflectance values.  The second bark reflectance pattern does
not have the jump at 0.7 µm and increases monotonically through the
visible and near infrared.  Both bark types have similar patterns in
the mid infrared. The first type of bark tends to be found in the upper 
crown of the aspen.  The second type of bark is found low in the 
aspen canopy suggesting that it is older bark.

Five species of needle leafed trees were sampled in this study: 
jack pine (Pinus banksiana), red pine (Pinus resinosa), larch 
(Larix laricina), balsam fir (Abies balsamea) and black spruce 
(Picea glauca).  While the reflectance pattern of the needle leafed
trees is similar to broad leaves, the reflectance of the 
needles is much more variable in all wavelengths. The variability 
in needle reflectance is not just a function of species since 
jack pine has both high and low reflectance values.  In the 
visible region, the red pine and larch reflectances are similar 
to broad leaf reflectance, but fir and the low value for jack 
pine are much less.  In the near infrared plateau, there are two 
depressions occuring around 1.0 and 1.2 µm.  These depressions 
are also present in broad leaves but are less pronounced.  Broad 
leaf reflectance in the near infrared falls in the middle of the 
range of needle near infrared reflectances.  In the mid infrared 
region, broad leaf reflectance is much higher than that of needles.
The needle bottom reflectance has similar characteristics as the
needle top reflectance.  In the visible region, fir has a greater
bottom reflectance than top reflectance.

Needle transmittance is much lower in all wavelengths than that of
broad leaves.

While the reflectance of the bark of needle leafed treesshows a
great deal of variability, the pattern of the reflectance is the
same as that of aspen bark from the lower canopy.  The needle
leaved tree bark does not show a jump at the visible-near infrared
boundary as does some of the aspen bark.

Several samples of black spruce needles were measured to look at 
the variability of optical properties within a conifer species.  
Spruce needle top reflectance falls mid range with other needle 
reflectances.  Within spruce, needles from high density stands 
have highest reflectance in near and mid infrared.  Needles from 
a middle density stand have lower reflectance in the near and mid 
infrared, with reflectances of needles from a low density stand 
being lowest in the near infrared and about the same as the mid 
density needles in the mid infrared.  Spruce needle reflectance 
data taken in 1983 were of a combination of both the tops and 
bottoms of the needles.  The results are comparable with the 1984
data in the near and mid infrared, however the 1983 visible
reflectances are much higher than the 1984 data.  This is not due
to the effects of needle bottom reflectance in 1983 samples since
the 1984 needle bottom reflectances in the visible are not much 
different than that of the needle tops and much lower than the 
1983 visible reflectances.  Spruce needle reflectance in comparison
with aspen leaf reflectance is a little lower in the visible, much
lower in the near infrared, and greatly lower in the mid infrared.

Spruce needle transmittance is slightly higher than other needle
transmittance in the visible and near infrared regions.  In
comparison with aspen leaf transmittance, they are nearly equal
in the visible, spruce is slightly lower in the near infrared,
and much lower in the mid infrared.

Three species of understory shrubs were sampled: beaked hazel 
(Corylus cornuta), labrador tea (Ledum groenlandicum) and 
leatherleaf (Chamaedaphne calyculata).  Only leaf top reflectance
was determined for labrador tea and leatherleaf.  The labrador tea
and leatherleaf have very high reflectances in the near infrared
compared to other leaves or needles sampled.  The hazel has much
lower reflectance in the near infrared.  The water absorption bands
at 1.4 and 1.9 µm are not very deep for the hazel.

Sphagnum moss (Sphagnum spp.) reflectance is extremely variable
in all bands.  The difference between samples may be caused by
differences in location, moisture or type of sphagnum.  Background
reflectance can have a significant effect on the total canopy reflectance.
If sphagnum is the background, the reflectance may vary with place and time.
This variable background can be an important complication in the understanding 
of reflectance images of the boreal forest regions.

In contrast to the sphagnum reflectance is the reflectance of 
aspen leaf litter.  The leaf litter reflectance is much different than
that of the sphagnum and appears to be more like the needle leafed
tree bark.

 values in the data file.

 8.  Data Organization:
 Data are sorted by species code (speccode), observation date (obs_datc),
 tree ID (tree_id), plant part (plntpart) and observation type (obs_type).
 Key fields in each record are speccode, obs_datc, tree_id and plntpart.

 Data Granularity:
 This data set consists of a single ASCII file containing reflectance
 and transmittance of leaves, needles and bark of various species of
 trees, with additional information on canopy position and stand density.

 Data Format:
 The data files associated with this data set consist of numeric
 and character fields of varying lengths aligned in columns.

 The first row of each data file contains the 8-character SAS
 variable name that links to the data format definition file.

 Character fields are enclosed in double quotes and numeric
 fields are listed without quotes.

 Missing data values can be of two varieties:
   *  values that were identified as missing in the original data files
        Missing numeric values of this type are identified
        in these data as -999.

   *  those holes that were created as a result of combining files that
       contained a slightly different variable set.
         Missing values of this type are identified
         in these data files as empty double quotes
         for character fields and a single period, '.'
         for numeric fields.

 Data Processing by Data Center:

 The Superior National Forest data was received from the
 Goddard Space Flight Center in three media:
  * as data dumps from the original Oracle SNF database
    maintained  by GSFC, transferred electronically
    from the GSFC system to the ORNL system
  * as ASCII files that mirrored the tables published
    in the Tech Memo
  * as hard copy (Tech Memo)

  Data from both electronic sources were input into SAS
  by ORNL DAAC data management staff and compared using
  computer code developed to process the SNF data.
  In many cases, the data values from both sources were found
  to be identical.  In some cases, however, differences were
  identified and the providers of the data were consulted to
  resolve inconsistencies.

  Additionally, some variable columns were available in one
  source, but not the other for various reasons.  For example,
  some calculated variables/columns were provided in the ASCII
  files (reflecting the Tech Memo tables) that were not stored
  in the Oracle database for purposes of space conservation.

  For similar reasons, coded values were used for many of the
  site and species identifier variables.  A separate reference
  table was provided to link the coded variable with its
  definition, e.g., the SPECIES_REF file and the SITE_REF file.

  The database produced by the ORNL DAAC is a hybrid product
  that is a composite of data and information extracted from
  all three source media.  In data sets where coded variables
  were included, the code definition variables have been added
  to improve usability of the data set as a stand-alone product.

  Therefore the ASCII files that are available through the
  ORNL DAAC on-line search and order systems are output from a
  data set that is a product of the essential core of numeric
  data provided by the data source (GSFC), augmented with
  additional descriptive information provided by GSFC
  and reorganized by the ORNL DAAC into a data structure consistent
  with other similar data sets maintained by the ORNL DAAC.
